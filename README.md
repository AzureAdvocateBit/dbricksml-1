# Machine Learning Workshop
The goal of this workshop is to get you acquainted with
Machine Learning and several of the tools, frameworks, and
processes one must follow to succeed.

# The Challenge
Our primitive digits consist of *mostly* horizontal and 
vertical lines.
![](synthetic.png?raw=true)
Our goal is to have a machine learning algorithm predict,
given a new *mostly* horizontal or vertical line, whether 
it **__is__** *mostly* horizontal or vertical.

# The Data
There are two methods of approaching getting the data:
1. Hercules Mode - Use the [raw images](linear.zip)
2. Not-Hercules Mode - Use a [csv](linear.csv)
3. I'm Lazy Mode - Use my [code](generate.py) to generate it...
